Pre-Built Packages for Stable version

To set up the yum repository for RHEL/CentOS, create the file named /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo with the following contents:

    [nginx]
    name=nginx repo
    baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/OS/OSRELEASE/$basearch/
    gpgcheck=0
    enabled=1

Replace “OS” with “rhel” or “centos”, depending on the distribution used, and “OSRELEASE” with “6” or “7”, for 6.x or 7.x versions, respectively.

For Debian/Ubuntu, in order to authenticate the nginx repository signature and to eliminate warnings about missing PGP key during installation of the nginx package, it is necessary to add the key used to sign the nginx packages and repository to the apt program keyring. Please download this key from our web site, and add it to the apt program keyring with the following command:

    sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key

For Debian replace codename with Debian distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx
    deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx

For Ubuntu replace codename with Ubuntu distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

    deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
    deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx

For Debian/Ubuntu then run the following commands:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install nginx

For SLES 12 run the following command:

    zypper addrepo -G -t yum -c 'http://nginx.org/packages/sles/12' nginx

For SLES 15 run the following command:

    zypper addrepo -G -t yum -c 'http://nginx.org/packages/sles/15' nginx
